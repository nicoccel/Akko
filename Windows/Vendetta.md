## Info

### Strange file

- `pagefile.sys`  
    a system file in Windows operating systems that serves as the virtual memory paging file.  
    It's used to store data that's not currently being used by the system, allowing the operating system to free up physical RAM for other tasks.

## Clean file

### Random command

```txt
del /q /f /s %temp%\*
ipconfig /flushdns
DISM /Online /Cleanup-Image /StartComponentCleanup
```
