# Bungee Gum x File Structure

## Help

The names of the files are names of songs that I like.

There cannot be two rows with the same name, this is very important.

It is not worth that they are on different folders.

The title of each file must be composed of the **clean** name of the song followed by `x` and the name of the topic.

The artist's name must be reported immediately after the title, it must be the only **object** in the main body.

The content of the file/guide must be divided into chapters with appropriate names.

It is recommended to bring the guide links from here it was a cue to solve a problem.

Use the terms **`DOC`** or **`LINK`** .
